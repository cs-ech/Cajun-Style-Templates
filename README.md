This is Fenhl's fork of the [Cajun Style Templates](https://github.com/CajunAvenger/Cajun-Style-Templates), a collection of [Magic Set Editor](https://github.com/twanvl/MagicSetEditor2) files representing modern Magic frames. This fork adds some features required for the custom sets on [Lore Seeker](https://lore-seeker.cards/).

# Installation

1. Download the zip file from [the latest Magic Set Editor release](https://github.com/twanvl/MagicSetEditor2/releases/latest).
2. Extract the zip file. It will contain 3 items:
    * a folder `data`, which is where the Cajun Style Templates will be installed later.
    * `magicseteditor.com`, a command-line version of MSE for advanced users.
    * `magicseteditor.exe`, the regular version of the app.
3. Download and extract [this zip file](https://github.com/fenhl/Cajun-Style-Templates/archive/fenhl.zip).
4. Inside the extracted folder, open the subfolder `Magic - Cajun Style Fonts`. It contains several `.ttf` files. Select them all, right-click on one of them, then click Install.
5. Move or copy all other subfolders into your MSE `data` folder.
